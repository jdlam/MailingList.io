Through backbone and our local api, any followers added are instantly updated on the screen.

# User Stories

User inputs valid information into the text boxes, the submit button is then enabled.

User presses the "submit" button, then the text boxes are cleared, the submit button is disabled, and the follower has been created, and rendered on the screen.

User presses the "Remove" button, and the follower is removed from both the database and the screen.
